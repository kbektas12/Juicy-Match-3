# Juicy Match 3
3rd project for MSCH-C220

10/9/2021

## Implementation
Includes two original soundtrack songs made by me (1 for each level to match. The first level is a time trial so the music is excited and fast paces, the second level's music is more relaxed.
Contains two levels (with different game-play mechanics and soundtrack)
Changed colors
Animated elements (including when tile selected)
Shakes the screen when something good happens
Added shaders
Particle effects on elements 
Elements rotate, fall and disappear when matched (used a shader teleport effect)
Background to game and menu
Changes to typeface

## Future Development
I really wanted to add sound effects, and I know how to. But couldn't find any good ones that I liked. I ended up not adding them. That probably is my biggest regret.

I could add levels and difficulty barriers like candy crush.
